# Jentis-coding-challenge
1. I added the basic code of Cookiebot
2. I added some scripts from the folder to the test_page.html to connect Jentis engine with the html page.
3. I added few eventListeners with which I called some functions of the Jentis consent engine depending on Cookiebot each consent
